# AURA
Power Electronics Optimization Framework

## Description
The Switched Mode Power Supply Toolbox provides capabilities for the steady-state and small-signal modeling of switched mode power supplies.  These capabilities facilitate design optimization in power electronics for a variety of applications.  

## System Requirements
The toolbox is tested with MATLAB R2022b and after.  Known issues will occur with MATLAB versions prior to R2020b.  

## Installation
See latest toolbox releases from the [Releases](https://github.com/costinet/AURA/tree/master/Releases) folder of the repository.  Drag and drop the mlbtx file into your matlab workspace to install.  To view the installed files, uninstall, or manage the installation of the toolbox, go to MATLAB Home->Add-Ons->Manage Add-Ons and find "Switched Mode Power Supply Toolbox" in your list of installed toolboxes.
