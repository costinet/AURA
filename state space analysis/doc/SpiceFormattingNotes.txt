%%%%%% Allowable Elements
M, V, I, L, C, R, D
M: only three-terminal NMOS devices should be used.
V, I: Independent sources have their value dictated by the u vector, defined later in matlab.  Any variable or non-zero value can later be overwritten by changing u.  If their value is set to zero, they become meters


%%%%%% Allowable directives
K
.lib (limited support) e.g. transistors from the LTSpice standard.mos can be used, an dic NetlistCiruitParser().LTSpiceFolder is correctly defined, the code will search for the paramerter values from the model definition


%%%%%% Meters
Adding a 0V or 0A voltage/current source will result in the dual signal being placed in the output vector y.  e.g., placing a zero current I-source in parallel with a resistor will result in the resistor voltage being an output signal.

%%%%%% Transformers
Coupled inductors are currently only allowed with perfect coupling (k==1).  The turns ratio is the square root of the ratio of the winding inductances.
However, setting a coupling greater than one in a "K" statement will implement an ideal transformer with infinite magnetizing inductance (while modeling with k==1)
Include a ground reference on each isolated subcircuit when transformers are used.

%%%%%% Parameters
Component parameters defined anywhere in the netlist line will be treated as variables when imported to Matlab
MOSFET parameters recognized include ron and Coss
Any separate .param statements in the netlist will be evaluated in the base workspace in MATLAB when the netlist is parsed.
