### v0.3.2
- Added functionality for multi-winding transformers
- Updated warning message for port assignment on transformers
- Updated error messaging when LTspice executable not found
- Fixed an error where circuits without any switched couldn't be parsed

### v0.3.1
- added forwarding functions in SMPSim to prevent the need to access parser and converter for basic data update
- added a check for first run of the toolbox that will ask to update
- fixed issue with transparency on some figures
- Updated parser.updateComponentValues to also try to populate the input vector, if possible
- fixed an issue in findValidSteadyState where the error checking could prevent any timing update to occur

### v0.2.9
- add findAvgModelTF()
- update error reporting on conflict with RFtoolbox and class capacitor()
- minor bugfixes

### v0.2.8
- removed net sync (unfinished) code
- added StoredTopology class and TopologyDB
- added modularTopology class
- Continued refactoring LTspiceCircuitParser into NetlistCircuitParser.  NetlistCircuitParser is now default for unspecified model parsing.  Former will be depricated over time.
- Moved additional settings into user files that will persist as versions updated.
- minor bugfixes

### v0.2.7
- Added changelog
- Initial implementation of switchLosses() function in SMPSim to calculate per-switch average loss
- Refactoring LTspiceCircuitParser into NetlistCircuitParser.  Former will be depricated over time
- Initial implementaition of modularCircuitParser to allow modular (e.g. multilevel) topologies
- Added saveTopology and loadTopology classes to circuitParser to prep for stored topologies in AURAdb
- Updated findSSTF to allow multiple input times, with gains, and to allow output sampling to happen at a time other than the end of the period.
- Implementing MATLAB test
